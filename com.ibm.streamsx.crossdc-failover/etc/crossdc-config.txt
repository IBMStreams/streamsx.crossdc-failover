# 1) This reference file has the configuration details for one data center (dc1).
#    You can take a copy of this file and change the configuration below to suit your 
#    data center specific values. After that, pass the fully qualified
#    name for this file via a CrossDataCenterFailover composite 
#    parameter named configFileName in your application. 
#    Specific configuration parameters that will change are listed here:
#    DC1 name, DC1 operation mode, Remote DC2 application machine name(s) and 
#    Data snapshot storage directory.
#
# 2) You can take a copy of this file and modify the configuration 
#    for the other data center (dc2).
#    Specific configuration parameters that will change are listed here:
#    DC2 name, DC2 operation mode, Remote DC1 application machine name(s) and 
#    Data snapshot storage directory.
#
# NOTE
# ---- 
# Please note that you can use this way of specifying the 
# crossdc-failover configuration details via a text file 
# irrespective of whether you will run your application as
# distributed or standalone. In case your application is
# run as distributed and if you want to store the crossdc-failover
# configuration details in the IBM Streams appconfig facility,
# please see a reference shell script (make-crossdc-appconfig.sh)
# available in the same directory as the text file you are currently reading.
# Configuration details specified via this text based
# config file will always take precedence even if you have
# made another set of configuration via the app config facility.
